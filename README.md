# Microbiome Mini-course: Data Presentation Workshop

Date: Friday May 14, 2021 <br>
Time:  3:00-5:00 p.m. <br>


## Workshop summary

A hands-on tutorial discussing tools and tips for figure making and data visualization. This is meant to be a fun, practical tutorial on making and refining high-quality diagrams and figures for use in presentations, posters, or publications using the free, open-source vector graphics editor Inkscape as well as RStudio with the package ggplot2.


## Preparation before class

[**Inkscape**](https://inkscape.org)
Inkscape is an open-source, cross-platform (MacOS, Windows, or Linux) graphics editor that is a good free alternative to Adobe Illustrator. We will learn the basics of using Inkscape. Please download and install before class; note that a fresh install may take up to 15 minutes. 

[**RStudio Desktop**](https://www.rstudio.com)
RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE) for R, allowing us to write and run code, with many additional features and customizability. We will be generating and refining plots in RStudio using the ggplot2 package. You should already have R, RStudio, and ggplot2 installed from the previous tutorial. If not, please download and install before class. 

Note: During our Zoome class, I will demo exercises while sharing my screen. As a participant, you may also be asked to share your screen to encourage everyone to try these exercises on their own computer and become familiar with the software. Note that this workshop is meant to be casual, fun, and to facilitate learning!

Advantages of using free tools:
- No dependence on expensive licenses, which may be lost after leaving institution
- No pirating software
- Sharing knowledge with others 

Disadvantages:
- Free or open-source usually means fewer features and perhaps more bugs and crashes; be patient and save freqeuntly!


## Inkscape exercises

We briefly cover the difference between [raster and vector images]() and do some exercises to learn to use Inkscape.

### Inkscape Basics
  - General interface
  - Canvas dimensions
  - Fill and Stroke
  - Aligning
  - Save as pdf; exporting png
  
### Clipping
We isolate an object in a photograph.
- Download the [photograph of a Petri dish]()
- 

### Simplifying
We smooth manually drawn strokes 

### Editing
We modify an existing vector graphic from Wikimedia Commons

### Tracing
We convert a raster image into a vector image


## Figure Critique 

We critique a real figure generated by and used with permission from my colleague. 

- Download the [multi-panel figure]()
- Spend 5 minutes  


## Figure Refinement in RStudio
We will recreate and refine a few of the panels from the figure critique example

- figure refinement [data1]() 
- figure refinement [data2]()
